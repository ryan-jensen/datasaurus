# Datasaurs

To build, install the haskell [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) tool. Then do `stack setup && stack build`. To run do `stack 
exec -- ds-exe`, which will produce a file `all.csv`. An old version of this also produced videos of the stats and barcodes, included here. In 
the new version, the file `all.csv` is run through an R-script to produce html files which are also included in this repo.
