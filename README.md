To build, install the stack tool. Then do `stack setup && stack build`. To run do `stack exec -- ds-exe`, which will produce a file `all.csv`. An old 
version of this also produced videos of the stats and bar codes. In the new version, the file `all.csv` is run through an R-script to produce html 
files.
